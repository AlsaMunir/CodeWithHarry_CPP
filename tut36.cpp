/*


4 types of Inheritance in C++:
-----------------------------------------------------
1) Single Inheritance. A --> B

A: Parent Class or Base Class
B: Child Class or Derived Class
-------------------------------------------------------
2) Multiple Inheritance. A,B --> C

- A derived class with more than 1 base class.

A,B: Base Classes
C: Derived Class
-------------------------------------------------------
3) Hierarchical Inheritance. A --> B,C

- Several derived classes from a single base class

A: Base Class
B,C: Derived Classes
-------------------------------------------------------
4) Multilevel Inheritance. A --> B --> C

- Deriving a class from already derived class

A: Base Class
B: Derived Class of A
C: Derived Class of B
-------------------------------------------------------

5) Hybrid Inheritance. A --> B,C --> D

- It is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance

- A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance

- However, one of the parent classes is not a base class
